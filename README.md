# Noughts and Crosses

## The classic pen-and-paper game for two players

A couple of years ago, I built a [noughts and crosses](https://github.com/kieranbarker/tic-tac-toe) game as part of my [Full-Stack JavaScript Techdegree](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/full-stack-javascript). It works, but it's overly complicated and riddled with A11Y issues.

I've learned a lot since then, so this is my attempt at rebuilding it with [state-based UI](https://gomakethings.com/state-based-ui-with-vanilla-js/). I'm using [Reef](https://github.com/cferdinandi/reef), an anti-framework my friend [Chris Ferdinandi](https://gomakethings.com/) created. It uses the same principles as the big guys like React, *at a fraction of the size.*
